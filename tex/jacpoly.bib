	abstract = {Several algorithms are given and compared for computing Gauss quadrature rules. It is shown that given the three term recurrence relation for the orthogonal polynomials generated by the weight function, the quadrature rule may be generated by computing the eigenvalues and first component of the orthornormalized eigenvectors of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. An algorithm is also presented for computing the three term recurrence relation from the moments of the weight function.},

	abstract = { In this paper, we demonstrate that many of the computational tools for univariate orthogonal polynomials have analogues for a family of bivariate orthogonal polynomials on the triangle, including Clenshaw's algorithm and sparse differentiation operators. This allows us to derive a practical spectral method for solving linear partial differential equations on triangles with sparse discretizations. We can thereby rapidly solve partial differential equations using polynomials with degrees in the thousands, resulting in sparse discretizations with as many as several million degrees of freedom. }
